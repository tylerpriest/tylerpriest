## Installing Ruby on Rails

For this Ruby on Rails build you will get Ruby through Rbenv, Rails, OhMyZsh!, Git, iTerm, Sublime, Homebrew & Command Line Tools 
 
I am assuming that you have a fresh, clean install of OS X 10.9 Mavericks
 
Lets install everything we need
 
First we want command line tools
 
xcode-select -p
 
 
Thanks!
