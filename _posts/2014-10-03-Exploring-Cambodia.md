Cambodia is the next awesome place I am going, flying into Siem Reap from Singapore after visiting my brothers, spending a few days there exploring Ankor Wat and Siem Reap itself.

My friend Chris who I met in CX hostel, Bali has recommended I stay at Mad Monkey's so far his recommendations around SE Asia have been good so will definitely give them a go there are three, one in Siem Reap in Phnom Penh and Kampot the 3 places I plan on going so that is great if they are as good as he says I have my accomodation sorted ! If not well I am tempted to stay with some locals and immerse my self in the culture a bit.

Kampot has a kitesurfing school so very  excited to go there. My knowledge of Cambodia is not complete so I need to make a list of places to visit, Ankor Wat (which in my mind I keep on mixing up with the Discworld Ankh-Morpork) is at the top of list and the beaches in South Cambodia are second after that is Kitesurfing and the Killing fields the rest I will follow advice of people in the hostel who have already travelled through its the best way to do it.

More Adventurin!

Next stop after this is back to Singapore or Vietnam if I decide on Vietnam I need to get the Visa sorted soon.
